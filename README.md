# The ORACLE-D Framework

## Description
The Optimised Resource Analysis and Carbon Legacy Estimator for Data centres (ORACLE-D) Framework is a framework for simulating different types of compute nodes, seeing how they deal with incoming jobs, and how much power consumed/carbon emitted in doing so. The initial idea was to use this to investigate how energy consumption and/or carbon usage can be reduced an average Grid computing site. This software was written in Python3

## Project status
Version 0.1.0 has been presented at the 2024 HEPiX Spring Workshop in Paris.   
Version 1.0.0: Antares has been tagged for release on 31st March 2026.

## Current Functionality
The simulation framework is designed to simulate the amount of energy and carbon used* when a computing site[1] performing work[2] is run in different ways[3]. The simulation is modular so [1],[2] and[3] are easily editable. 

\* All the nodes that make up the computing site output the amount of energy they have used every time-step (10 minutes), this is also multiplied by the carbon intensity of the UK grid to estimate the carbon emissions per time-step.

[1] A computing site is made up solely of a specified type(s) and number(s) of compute nodes defined in src/cluster/WorkerNode.py which run work.

[2] The work that the nodes run is made up jobs that are specified in src/jobs/VOJobFactory.py, and are inserted into the simulation either at the beginning of the simulation or at fixed durations throughout the simulation in src/jobs/JobScheduler.py.

[3] The different saving policies that the simulation can be run with are specified via a setting in config.json. This policy changes the frequency the nodes are run at and at what times of day this is done. Current running options are

| Running Flag  | Description |
| :------------: | :------ |
| None          |  Run the nodes as standard  |
| cd            |  Runs all the nodes clocked down one frequency step from the reported maximum frequency for the entire duration of the simulation    | 
| cdcd          |  Runs all the nodes clocked down two frequency steps from the reported maximum frequency for the entire duration of the simulation      |
| cd1721        |  Runs all the nodes clocked down one frequency step from the reported maximum frequency only between the hours of 5pm and 9pm  |
| cdcd1721      |  Runs all the nodes clocked down two frequency steps from the reported maximum frequency only between the hours of 5pm and 9pm   |
| highforecast  |  Runs all the nodes clocked down one frequency step from the reported maximum frequency only when the forecasted usage is high (> 400gCO2e/kWh)   |

The Simulation has two encoded end conditions
  1) All the jobs sent to the cluster have been completed
  2) The amount of time in seconds specified with self._simulation_length has passed

**Outputs**
-  Number of jobs started and finished. 
-  Total and Peak-time (17h-21h) Estimated Energy used in kWh.
-  Total and Peak-time Estimated Carbon (C02e) used in kg.
-  Total and average CPU duration.
-  Total real-time and simulated-time passed.
-  Average occupancy of the cluster

### Package Dependencies
ORACLE-D has external package requirements in requirements.txt

For those that use pip and venv to manage environment, you can run these commands that creates a virtual environment called 'venv' to hold the environment needed for the project. 
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting started with the first run
To run this simulation in this folder type the command:
```
python3 src/Main.py
```

The default running mode is to run 40,000 'ATLAS' and 10,000 'LHCb' jobs on the on the DESY Grid compute cluster from 2024-01-16 16:00 without any special running conditions. This could run for a couple of minutes and produce a log output, and the file RF20PMTest-50000LHCJobs-Base.txt with the summary of the output. The information of grid carbon intensity is taken from data/de_carbon_Intensity_2024_15min.csv. This can be compared to the file that exists already in the folder which takes the same job mix started at the same time but clocks down the machines when the carbon intensity of the grid is forecast in the next time-step to be high. On line 63 of src/simulation/simulation.py, you can see 'high' for the German grid is taken to be 400 gCO2e/kWh and 200 gCO2e/kWh if you want to run on the UK electrical grid.

## Configuration
The simulation is configured via the config.json file. In there, all relevant parameters are specified. They are split into several sections dealing with the different parts of the code.

### Simulation
The parameters that can be changed for the simulation include:

| Variables to edit  | Description |
| :------------: | :------ |
| desiredStartTime          | The time at which the simulation starts. Leaving this black defaults to clock time  |
| simulation_length   | The maximum duration that the will simulation will run for in seconds | 
| timestep   | The timestep the simulation does in between each update in seconds | 
| savings_policy   | The savings policy specified in an earlier section. The options are "None", "cd", "cdcd", "cd1721", "cdcd1721", and "highforecast". | 

### carbon_intensity
The parameters that define information on the carbon intensity. They include:

| Variables to edit  | Description |
| :------------: | :------ |
| folder          | The folder where the carbon intensity data is stored  |
| filename   | The filename of the carbon intensity data | 
| high_CI_threshold   | The threshold of what is considered a high carbon intensity in gCO2e/kWh | 

### jobs

TODO

## Adding Extra Options
If you want amend the measurements for each node or add different types of node not yet in the simulation. This needs to be done at the bottom of src/cluster/WorkerNode.py.

To add new machines you will need the following information:
- name
- number of (hyper)threads
- amount of memory available to the node
- the value of the power displaced when node is IDLE
- the value of the power displaced when the node is fully occupied with work at its maximum frequency value
- HEPScore value for the node at its maximum frequency value
- (optional) the value of the power displaced of a fully occupied node at its alternative frequency values
- (optional) the HEPScore value of a fully occupied node at its alternative frequency values
